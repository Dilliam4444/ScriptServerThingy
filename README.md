# ScriptServerThingy
Hi guys,

Basically all of the loadstrings will be here with the name of the script above them.
There may be some ones that we HAVENT made but like who cares.
Also access the raw code in the raw code thing where the raw code is.
( i did not try to fit the word "Raw code" in there as many times as i could)
